# Methodology considerations

## What is a NAP?
A national access point is a digital access point, through which public transport information can be obtained. The data mist either directly available or the necessary meta data is provided on where and how to get it.

## Perspective
* We will try to do the table to see, if NAP datasets or services show promise to be used by potential users.
* We will employ 5 star categorisation where necessary.
* The analysis is done often in a qualitative way.
* Risk involved in using the datasets/interface will be shown. E.g. if the actualisation is not working, the license is poor, the data set is incomplete or too shallow.
* We will invite participants from different countries to include their opinion about given NAP.

## Categorisation of the offers

|Type|Examples|Relevent aspects|
|--|--|--|
|Scheduled (lines)|air, railwail, suburbanrail, bus, ferries)|timetable base offers, mass transport|
|Demand-responsive|shuttle, taxi, car-pooling, rentals, sharing|ordering the offer, mostly single user|
|personal|car, cycle, motorcycle|vehicle is owned by user and directly available|

## Categorisation of NAP functionality

|Function|Description|
|--|--|
|road|road network with street type, allowed use, speed limit etc. real time|
|geo|POI and addresses|
|timetablebased|timetables, stops, delays, cancellation, extra, occupation, capacity, offers, price|
|on-demand|demand responsive (especially when not line-based), geofences, offers, availability, price||
|trip planner|interactive trip planner or API(s)|
|directory|a directory to services|

A possibility is to put all on demand traffic that is provided by "official" providers from the on-demand category to the timetable-based and have the privates without special license in the other.
